👀 I’m interested in …
HR tech, OKRs, and anything that helps people actually use the tools they’re given. Also: creating Pixar versions of my face, building shortcuts so I don’t forget things, and slowly turning into the IT guy for my kids.

🌱 I’m currently learning …
how to automate my life one Apple Shortcut at a time, how to build an app that listens better than I do, and how to sneak vegetables into a meal without anyone under 10 filing a formal complaint.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on …
apps that make performance reviews suck less, integrations that actually integrate, and anything that involves demoing like a boss. Also open to projects where I can pretend I know what I’m doing with JavaScript.

📫 How to reach me …
Carrier pigeon discouraged. Try paulagustin.com, Bluesky, or yelling “API TIME!” near a conference room — I’ll probably show up.

😄 Pronouns:
he/him (and occasionally “Dad, where’s my iPad charger?”)

⚡ Fun fact:
I once convinced my dog to wear Halloween costumes, Christmas PJs, and smile for photos — she had more patience than I do when someone’s goal due date is 12/31/99.
